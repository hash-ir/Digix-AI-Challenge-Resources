## Competition track B: Computer vision
Digital device image retrieval

Accurate image retrieval is a core technology for shopping by picture taking, and also becomes a hotspot in the academia and industry. This proposal provides a training dataset, including coarse-grained images of digital devices, such as mobile phones, smart wearables, PCs, tablets, speakers, and routers, as well as fine-grained images (for example, images of mobile phones with different appearance) to complete a digital device image retrieval task in a real snap-to-shop scenario. That is, algorithms can be used to find a digital device image in the gallery and return it based on the given query image of the device.
Contestants are required to build and submit models based on the given dataset. The results are then evaluated, according to their top-1 accuracy and mAP@10.
This proposal aims to find talented individuals to improve image retrieval algorithms.

## Scoring rules of competition track B
1. During the preliminary, each team must complete the proposal and submit their work, according to the outlined requirements.
The score a team obtains is weighted by the following two indicators: 0.5 for the top 1 search accuracy rate and 0.5 for mAP@10.
The total size of the model a team submits cannot exceed 500 MB; otherwise, the team cannot obtain any score.
15 teams will be shortlisted for the elite final, as determined by the automatic scoring and qualification review results.
If a team fails to pass the review (for example, due to cheating), all of the teams below it on the leaderboard will automatically move up by one spot.
2. During the elite final, the first prize, second prize, third prize, and honorable mentions will be determined according to the stage B and presentation results.
a. Presentation: Each team will be responsible for preparing presentation materials, and making a presentation for the judging panel.
b. Selection: The judging panel will comprehensively evaluate works according to the automatic scoring and presentation results, and determine the final ranking and award list.
